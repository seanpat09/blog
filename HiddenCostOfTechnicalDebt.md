#The Hidden Cost of Technical Debt

The term technical debt is frequently used in the software development world to serve as a metaphor for doing things the quick and dirty way in order to get something out of the door sooner rather than later. Just like financial debt, accruing technical debt is not necessarily a bad thing if the value of delivering something more quickly outweighs the development costs (i.e. the interest) of fixing the quick and dirty solution in the future. However, the interest expense analogy usually stops there, ignoring the less quantifiable, more human side of debt that could end up costing more.

Accumulating debt, both financial and technical, sucks. Developers (the good ones at least) want to build elegant, well-planned, and performant software. Being forced to accumlate technical debt typically means having to do the opposite.
They'll think, "I know I could do better, if I just had time!" During code review co-workers ask "You shouldn't do it this way," to which they can only respond in a defeated tone, "I know, but we need to get this out the door." And as the technical debt continues to build up they'll stare at the 100,000 line mess and think, "I've created a monster!"

It's also draining. Developers need to keep track of the technical debt, occupying precious mental resources. If another developer comes on board they'll need to spend time explaining the technical debt, why it can't be fixed at the moment and how to work around it. Just debugging anything takes ages because it is not clear where anything is. All of this can be exhausting and slowly chips away at any sense of pride for the code base or the product. 

##What you can do

1. Flexible deadlines should be known to the team
Don't set an arbitrary delivery date and then hide the fact that there is actually a significant buffer after that just in case. These aren't dinner reservations. When that deadline comes and goes without consequence you will probably end up with some unnecessary technical debt and a lot of resentment from your team.

2. Hard deadlines should have a reason
Ask yourself what would happen if you didn't deliver on time. If it means your company could lose out on funding and go out of business, let your developers know.
