# Hidden Cost of Technical Debt

The term technical debt is frequently used in the development world to serve as a metaphor for doing things the quick and dirty way in order to get something out of the door sooner than later. Just like financial debt, accruing technical debt is not necessarily a bad thing especially if the value of delivering something more quickly outweighs the development costs (i.e. the interest) of fixing the quick and dirty solution in the future. However, the interest expense analogy usually stops there, ignoring the less quantifiable, more human side of debt that could end up costing more.

While working on a project, developers (the good ones at least) strive to do things "right" while delivering features in a timely manner. Doing things "right", however, doesn't always align with doing things quickly so there needs to be some kind of compromise. It doesn't matter how this happened. Maybe the developer underestimated the scope or maybe there were some last minute requirement changes with no option to change the deadline. Whatever the case, the developer will need to sacrifice some code quality in order to deliver on time. Also, this will happen again and again.

That feeling sucks.

She says to yourself, "I know I could do better, if I just had time!" During code review co-workers ask "Why did you do it this way?" to which she can only respond in a defeated tone, "I know... but we need to get this out the door." And as the technical debt continues to build up she stares at the 15,000 line mess and thinks "I've created a monster!"

It's also draining. That developer needs to keep track of the technical debt, occupying precious mental resources. If another developer comes on board she'll need to spend time explaining the technical debt, why it can't be fixed at the moment and how to work around it. Just debugging anything takes ages because it's not clear where anything is. All of this can be exhausting for a developer and slowly chips away at any sense of pride for the code base or the product.

The worst outcome from too much technical debt is not a complete stand still in progress. Enough time and money can solve that problem. Technical debt does its most damage when your developer finally says "FUCK THIS" and leaves your company with a huge vacuum in knowledge and the daunting task of trying to find a replacement.
