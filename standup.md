#How to Run a Successful Daily Stand-Up Meeting

### 1) Invite as many people as possible
Bonus points if those people never work together! You need to make sure everyone you work with is doing their job so you might as well do it all at once. Nevermind that a majority of the meeting will be irrelevant to each attendee individually.

### 2) Schedule at least half an hour
Each person's update is going to take at least 2 minutes, maybe more if any questions arise, so make sure you allot enough time for everyone. You've got everyone in same place so this is also a great time to do any solutioning. And if you happen to finish early, start talking about anything. Let the conversation flow; everything is relevant! With 10 people at $50 an hour, this meeting costs $250 a day, but it's worth it!

### 3) Make sure you have plenty to say
The less you speak, the more it will seem like you're not doing your job. Talk about every meeting you're going to, every problem you had, read your calendar out loud if you need to. Also, interject into other people's updates so you appear engaged and informed.

By now, you should have realized I'm being sarcastic and if any of this sounds familiar, then you are doing it wrong. 

Daily stand-ups are a common practice in many technology companies, but I have rarely seen it done right. It usually turns into people trying to justify that they are busy, devolving into a 30 minute affair of no value. However, on the Galvanize Software team, our daily stand-up is never longer than 10 minutes and even that is a stretch. Here's a few ground rules that we've come up with for ours:

* Everyone should be standing, encouraging a short meeting
* The participants should all be on the same team, in order to keep the meeting relevant to everyone
* No one should touch their computers. If you're distracted, then why be there?
* Your updates should be high level: What you did yesterday, what you're doing today, and any roadblocks
* Keep it to a few sentences at most. If you need to get into the details, do it afterwards with the relevant participants
* If your stand-up is more than 6 people, you should consider breaking it up or it will get too long
* If conversation goes off topic, we say "Pancakes!" and we all immediately know to stop (don't ask)

The best thing that I have learned is that it is OK to have no update. It's better to have no update than to spew nonsense for a few minutes in order to seem busy. No one doubts that anyone is slacking off, and even if they did, the daily stand-up meeting wouldn't be the place to address that anyway.

A short stand up is meaningful because it provides context and direction for the rest of the day. A long stand up just leaves everyone frustrated and sluggish, wasting even more time.

Long meetings in general are deceptive. They give the illusion of productivity when they are usually anything but productive. So start cutting them short or stop having them at all. If you have to, stop the stand-up immediately at 10 minutes, even if everyone didn't get to speak. Eventually you and your team will get used to it and save time, time you could be using doing something instead of just talking about it.
